>
> Saving energy is easy, there are some ways: first, you can turn off the electric machines when you don't use it. Second, you can use laundry water to mop the floor. Also, you can read ebook from kindle to replace the paper book, because papers also need energy to make.
>
> In conclusion, we should all do our best to save energy, it can also protect our planet.
