### 原文

> [!NOTE]- 原文
> Do you believe that there are many young people about 14 or 15 years old who are famous pop stars? Some of them get well-knowned by making videos on social media. Some of them become famous by singing in front of a large number of people. In my opinion, being this kind of pop person isn't a simple thing.
>
> One of the reasons is that if you want to let more people remember you, you have to learn or improve some skills first. Doing this is difficult but important. And then, you should find some good ways to make you special and hard to forget in others' heart. For example, my friend Lucy is a teenage pop star, she said she practised singing for many hours every day, even when she had a fever.
>
> What's more, teenage pop stars also influence their fans. If a star loves dancing, the fans may get interested in dancing too, and maybe someone can find the talent when they are trying. Besides, they can learn from their favourite pop stars and be a kind and successful person.
>
> In short, teenage pop stars can continue their activities, but I think they and their fans should pay more attention to studying and school classes.
