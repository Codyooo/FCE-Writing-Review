### ✨ 润色版本（Polished Version）
> [!question]- 润色版本
> From my perspective, it is not easy to become a teenage pop star. It takes a lot of work. First, you need strong singing skills. However, at school you can only learn how to sing and rarely how to arrange songs, so it would definitely take a lot of time to learn.
>
> In addition, your parents might interfere because it will affect your study. If a teenager becomes a pop star, their fans may think they can make it too, which may not be a good influence on society. Therefore, being a teenage pop star is not a good way for teenagers to stand out. The best choice is still to study hard at school.
