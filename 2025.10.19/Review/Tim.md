> No, I don't think it's easy. It can take a lot of work. First, if you want to be a famous teenage pop star, you need to be good at Chinese and English music. But in school, you only can learn how to sing but cannot learn the way of arrange songs. So it would definitely takes a lot of time to learn it. Also, your parents might interfere with you because it will effect on your study. At last, if a teenagers become a pop stars, their fans may think that they also can make it, especially to other teenagers. It wouldn't be a good influence of society, so teenage pop star isn't a good way of teenagers to stand out. The best choice is still study hard in schools.
