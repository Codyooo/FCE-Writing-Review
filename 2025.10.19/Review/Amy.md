>
> What things in your daily life do you use energy to do? For example, I use the phones to call my friends every day. It costs energy, even every thing we used need to use energy.
>
> But the energy is not endless. For example, the electricity comes from coals. But the coals need quite a long time to create, so we need to save energy.
>
> Saving energy is easy, there are some ways: first, you can turn off the electric machines when you don't use it. Second, you can use laundry water to mop the floor. Also, you can read ebook from kindle to replace the paper book, because papers also need energy to make.
>
> In conclusion, we should all do our best to save energy, it can also protect our planet.
